Steganography is the practice of encoding hidden  information into an audio, video, image, or text file. It is one of the  strategies used to safeguard sensitive or secret information  against malicious intrusions. We concentrate on image  steganography in this report, which is the practice of concealing  information within an image file.  

Steganalysis is the art and science of identifying the use of  steganography. Steganalysis often entails a number of processing  steps, including noise removal, cropping, blurring, image scaling,  and compression. To find hidden information in a stego image,  there are many steganalysis tools accessible. 

No one is supposed to understand that there exists a secret  message in the image other than the intended receiver. So there  shouldn't be any distortions, color shifts, or noise in the image as  a result of the hidden message. The concealed message should also  not be easily accessible to the intruders. We attempt to solve this  problem through this paper. 

We conclude this by giving a solutions to the above problem.  We do it by encrypting the information before embedding it in the  image, testing against various attacks
